For non-Polish speakers
=======================
This is my presentation from Java Dev Days 2013.

Move around with arrow keys, except when on booklet or image gallery.
Booklet navigation is plugged on &gt and &lt keys and image gallery for now requires a mouse.


See http://littleancientforestkami.github.io/JDD-2013-talk/JDD_Przestańmy_się_zakładać.html for live presentation.

Commit splitting
----------------
Since I've worked in a zone and forgot about VCSes then, this repo is also a nice playground for splitting commits:
